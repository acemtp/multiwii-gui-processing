GUI Processing - GitHub mirror of the official SVN MultiWii
===

Introduction
---

The official development of [MultiWii](http://www.multiwii.com/) is stored in a [SVN](http://code.google.com/p/multiwii/source/browse/).

But we are more and more developers who want to use GitHub to code that's why we created the GitHub [https://github.com/multiwii](multiwii) organization.

The goal of this organization is to federate and centralize the GitHub community effort behind multiwii.

This project is a mirror of the svn that is syncronized automatically. So you'll see every SVN commit with the commit author and comment.

It contains the *gui config* part of the MultiWii project.
